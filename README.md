# FinancialEngineering18
Master of Financial Engineering from Baruch College, City University of New York 

This repository contains final projects of Financial Engineering course with great emphasis place on options pricing with 
various methods such as Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo and Finite-Difference-Method. Additional libraries include Boost C++ & 
home-made UtilitiesDJD provided by the course. Most of these projects are created on CLion compiler (C++ 98), and should work
fine on VS compiler too. 

I have also attached some useful design patterns, data structures and algorithms for future references. To note, one can always use multithreading to achieve such effect for more efficient Monte Carlo pricing if you're fed up of waiting too long for the simulations. 

Commentary: 
A good continuation for option trading strategies (not covered 
in this course) can be extended to Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning 
in Finance, offered by NYU Tandon School of engineering.
